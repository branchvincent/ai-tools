# Markov Decision Process Solver

This is a [Markov Decision Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) (MDP) solver. An MDP is defined by a set of states, rewards, and probabilistic transitions. The solution to an MDP is an optimal policy that maximizes the reward.

## Method
The solver implements both value iteration and policy iteration to obtain the optimal policy.

## Setup
Python 2.7.13 was chosen as the programming language for this assignment. In addition to Python2, the `numpy` package is also required. This can be installed, if not already, via the following command:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## [Example Problem](https://github.com/branchvincent/ai-tools/blob/master/mdp-solver/doc/report.pdf)
You need to run `mdp.py`, which has the following usage:
```python
python mdp.py
```
